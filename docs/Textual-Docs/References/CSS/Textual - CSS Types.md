## CSS TypesÂ¶

CSS types define the values that Textual CSS styles accept.

CSS types will be linked from within the [styles reference](https://textual.textualize.io/styles/) in the "Formal Syntax" section of each style. The CSS types will be denoted by a keyword enclosed by angle brackets `<` and `>`.

For example, the style [`align-horizontal`](https://textual.textualize.io/styles/align/) references the CSS type [`<horizontal>`](https://textual.textualize.io/css_types/horizontal/):

```
align-horizontal: <horizontal>;
```
