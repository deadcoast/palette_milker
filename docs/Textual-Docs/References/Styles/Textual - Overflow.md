## Overflow¶

The `overflow` style specifies if and when scrollbars should be displayed.

## Syntax¶

```
overflow: <overflow> <overflow>;

overflow-x: <overflow>;
overflow-y: <overflow>;
```

The style `overflow` accepts two values that determine when to display scrollbars in a container widget. The two values set the overflow for the horizontal and vertical axes, respectively.

Overflow may also be set individually for each axis:

- `overflow-x` sets the overflow for the horizontal axis; and
- `overflow-y` sets the overflow for the vertical axis.

### Defaults¶

The default setting for containers is `overflow: auto auto`.

Warning

Some built-in containers like `Horizontal` and `VerticalScroll` override these defaults.

## Example¶

Here we split the screen into left and right sections, each with three vertically scrolling widgets that do not fit into the height of the terminal.

The left side has `overflow-y: auto` (the default) and will automatically show a scrollbar. The right side has `overflow-y: hidden` which will prevent a scrollbar from being shown.

from textual.app import App
from textual.containers import Horizontal, VerticalScroll
from textual.widgets import Static

TEXT = """I must not fear.
Fear is the mind-killer.
Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.
I will face my fear.
I will permit it to pass over me and through me.
And when it has gone past, I will turn the inner eye to see its path.
Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain."""

class OverflowApp(App):
    CSS_PATH = "overflow.tcss"

    def compose(self):
        yield Horizontal(
            VerticalScroll(Static(TEXT), Static(TEXT), Static(TEXT), id="left"),
            VerticalScroll(Static(TEXT), Static(TEXT), Static(TEXT), id="right"),
        )

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = OverflowApp()
    app.run()
```

```
Screen {
    background: $background;
    color: black;
}

VerticalScroll {
    width: 1fr;
}

Static {
    margin: 1 2;
    background: green 80%;
    border: green wide;
    color: white 90%;
    height: auto;
}

#right {
    overflow-y: hidden;
}
```

## CSS¶

```
/* Automatic scrollbars on both axes (the default) */
overflow: auto auto;

/* Hide the vertical scrollbar */
overflow-y: hidden;

/* Always show the horizontal scrollbar */
overflow-x: scroll;
```

## Python¶

Overflow cannot be programmatically set for both axes at the same time.

```
# Hide the vertical scrollbar
widget.styles.overflow_y = "hidden"

# Always show the horizontal scrollbar
widget.styles.overflow_x = "scroll"
```
