# RERUN_12: Enhanced Palette Management and Color Tools

## Summary of Changes

This iteration focused on implementing comprehensive palette management features and powerful color tools that improve the user experience and functionality of the Palette Milker application.

### Palette Management Features

#### PaletteOrganizationScreen
- Created a dedicated screen for managing palettes with a consistent Textual-style interface
- Implemented features for renaming, duplicating, and deleting palettes
- Added reordering capabilities with up/down keyboard shortcuts
- Created a card-based UI for each palette with color preview
- Implemented modals for rename operations with proper focus management

#### Enhanced Palette Model
- Improved save/load functionality with proper error handling
- Added methods for palette organization (move up/down, duplicate)
- Implemented robust message passing for palette operations
- Ensured state consistency with reactive properties

### Color Tools

#### Color Harmony Generator
- Created a comprehensive harmony generator widget with various harmony types:
  - Complementary colors
  - Analogous colors
  - Triadic and tetradic harmonies
  - Split-complementary harmonies
  - Monochromatic variations
  - Shades and tints
- Implemented proper reactive properties for harmony generation
- Added interactive color selection with visual feedback
- Integrated accessibility information for color combinations

#### Color Accessibility Tools
- Created a dedicated AccessibilityScreen for testing color combinations
- Implemented WCAG contrast calculation and compliance checking
- Added visual previews for text on different backgrounds
- Created a suggestion system for improving low-contrast combinations
- Added color blindness simulation and compatibility checking
- Implemented one-click text optimization for any background

### Implementation Details

#### Color Accessibility Utilities
- Created comprehensive utility functions for accessibility checking
- Implemented WCAG 2.0 luminance and contrast ratio calculations
- Added helpers for suggesting accessible alternatives
- Created color blindness compatibility checks
- Added utilities for optimizing text colors

#### Textual Best Practices
- Used proper reactive properties with typed annotations
- Implemented message classes for component communication
- Created well-structured widget hierarchies
- Used proper event handling and delegation
- Added comprehensive keyboard navigation
- Provided visual feedback for interactive elements
- Implemented consistent error handling

## New Components

1. **src/widgets/color/harmony_generator.py**
   - HarmonyGenerator widget for generating color harmonies
   - HarmonyType enum for different harmony types
   - ColorSelected message for communication

2. **src/screens/palette_organization_screen.py**
   - PaletteOrganizationScreen for managing palettes
   - PaletteActionRequest message for requesting actions

3. **src/screens/accessibility_screen.py**
   - AccessibilityScreen for testing color accessibility
   - ColorPairSelected message for communication

4. **src/utils/color_accessibility.py**
   - Utility functions for accessibility checking
   - WCAG compliance calculations
   - Color blindness compatibility tools

## Example Usage

```python
# Using the harmony generator
harmony_gen = HarmonyGenerator(base_color="#FF5500")
harmony_gen.selected_harmony = HarmonyType.TRIADIC

# Using the accessibility screen
accessibility = AccessibilityScreen(palette=current_palette)
app.push_screen(accessibility)

# Checking color accessibility
contrast = calculate_contrast_ratio("#FFFFFF", "#000000")
compliance = get_wcag_compliance(contrast)
```

## Next Steps

While this iteration significantly improves palette management and color tools, future work could focus on:

1. Integrating the harmony generator with the color picker screen
2. Adding color accessibility warnings throughout the application
3. Implementing color scheme extraction from images
4. Adding more export formats for color palettes
